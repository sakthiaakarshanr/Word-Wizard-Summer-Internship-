## 📌 Overview

This project applies machine learning and NLP techniques to analyze Tamil poems. The system predicts:

- The **author** of a given Tamil poem  
- The **emotion** expressed in the poem  
- The **sentiment** conveyed  

We developed a Flask-based web application that provides real-time predictions with word cloud visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a structured dataset from Tamil classical poets  
- Engineer 24+ tailored features for Tamil poetic structure  
- Implement multiple ML algorithms and compare performance  
- Develop a web-based application for real-time poem analysis

## 🚧 Challenges

- Tamil language complexity (morphology, encoding, syntax)  
- Lack of annotated poetic corpora  
- Manual annotation of emotions/sentiment is time-intensive  

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- Add deep learning models (BERT, LSTM for Tamil)  
- Expand to more poets & modern literature  
- Automate annotation using language models  
- Enhance UI/UX and Tamil font rendering
